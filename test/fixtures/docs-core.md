# Core examples

The everyday syntax: text formatting, headings, links, images, lists, tables, code, attributes and more. Each pair shows Carve source and the HTML it produces; toggle the output to **Rendered** to see the result.

## Emphasis

::: compare

```carve
/italic/  *bold*  /*bold italic*/
_underline_  ~strikethrough~
=highlight=  {^super^}  {,sub,}
```

```html
<p><em>italic</em>  <strong>bold</strong>  <strong><em>bold italic</em></strong>
<u>underline</u>  <s>strikethrough</s>
<mark>highlight</mark>  <sup>super</sup>  <sub>sub</sub></p>
```

:::

The word-boundary rule applies to *every* bare delimiter (`/ * _ ~ =` — all single-char). No bare delimiter emphasizes intraword: `foo*bar*baz`, `foo~bar~baz`, `snake_case`, `a/b/c`, `x = 5`, `key=value` all stay literal. For deliberate intraword emphasis, use the forced `{X … X}` family (below). Superscript and subscript have *no* bare delimiter at all — they exist only in the braced forms `{^…^}` / `{,…,}` (see below). For any bare delimiter:

- an **opener** is recognized only if it is *not* followed by whitespace **and** is preceded by the start of the line/block, whitespace, or a punctuation character (not by an alphanumeric, `_`, or the same delimiter) — so `a/b/c`, `foo_bar_baz`, `snake_case`, and `//a/` stay literal, while `(/x/)` and `a./b/` open after punctuation;
- a **closer** is recognized only if it is *not* preceded by whitespace **and** *not* followed by an alphanumeric character — so `x /a/b y` stays literal.

Highlight is the single-char `=` delimiter; the uniform word boundary keeps `x = 5`, `key=value`, `a=b` literal. Every bare delimiter is single-char, so a *doubled* delimiter (`==x==`) is literal by the same-delimiter-adjacency rule, just like `**x**` or `//x//`. This is *stricter* than Djot, whose `_`/`*` rule is purely whitespace-flanking. `^` and `,` are *not* bare delimiters — a comma or caret in prose is always literal text (`1,2,3`, `a,b,c`, `x, y, z`, `2 ^ 3`), and superscript/subscript are written with the braced forms only. The boundary rule still allows `/usr/local/` → `<em>usr/local</em>`: the opening `/` sits at line start and the inner same-type `/` characters are literal content (Carve does not nest same-type emphasis). The normative rule lives in `resources/grammar.ebnf` PART 9 §9 and §22.

::: compare

```carve
foo*bar*baz and a/b/c stay literal.
```

```html
<p>foo*bar*baz and a/b/c stay literal.</p>
```

:::

An opener without a matching closer is left as a literal character.

::: compare

```carve
/foo bar
```

```html
<p>/foo bar</p>
```

:::

Escapes neutralize delimiters — `\/`, `\*`, `\_` render as the literal character.

::: compare

```carve
\/literal\/ and \*not bold\*
```

```html
<p>/literal/ and *not bold*</p>
```

:::

Emphasis nests freely; inner spans render inside outer ones.

::: compare

```carve
*bold with /italic/ inside* and /italic with *bold* inside/
```

```html
<p><strong>bold with <em>italic</em> inside</strong> and <em>italic with <strong>bold</strong> inside</em></p>
```

:::

Inner slashes inside a `/…/` span are literal content — a path-like span still parses as emphasis.

::: compare

```carve
/usr/local/
```

```html
<p><em>usr/local</em></p>
```

:::

Whitespace immediately after an opener (or before a closer) blocks emphasis — the delimiter renders literally.

::: compare

```carve
/ not emphasis /
```

```html
<p>/ not emphasis /</p>
```

:::

An opener may follow punctuation, not only whitespace or the line start.

::: compare

```carve
(/x/) and a./b/
```

```html
<p>(<em>x</em>) and a.<em>b</em></p>
```

:::

A closer is rejected when followed by an alphanumeric character, so an interrupted path stays literal.

::: compare

```carve
x /a/b y
```

```html
<p>x /a/b y</p>
```

:::

*No* bare delimiter produces intraword emphasis — `*` behaves like `/` and `_`.

::: compare

```carve
foo_bar_baz and snake_case stay literal
```

```html
<p>foo_bar_baz and snake_case stay literal</p>
```

:::

An emphasis opener (any bare delimiter) immediately preceded by the *same* delimiter or by a literal `_` is not valid (this does not affect different-delimiter combinations like `/*bold italic*/`, and a `_` that itself opens an underline span does not block a following opener).

::: compare

```carve
//a/ and snake_/case/
```

```html
<p>//a/ and snake_/case/</p>
```

:::

### Forced intraword emphasis

Wrapping a bare delimiter in a brace pair — `{/.../}`, `{*...*}`, `{_..._}`, `{~...~}`, `{^...^}`, `{,...,}`, `{=...=}` — forces a span with no word-boundary condition, so it emphasizes *intraword*. This is the escape hatch for the cases a bare delimiter leaves literal.

::: compare

```carve
foo{*bar*}baz and my{_path_}name and a{/b/}c
```

```html
<p>foo<strong>bar</strong>baz and my<u>path</u>name and a<em>b</em>c</p>
```

:::

The braces bound the span: a bare same-kind delimiter inside is literal, and cross-type marks nest normally.

::: compare

```carve
{/a/b/} and {/italic *bold*/}
```

```html
<p><em>a/b</em> and <em>italic <strong>bold</strong></em></p>
```

:::

Highlight is the single-char `=`; a doubled `==…==` is literal by the same-delimiter-adjacency rule.

::: compare

```carve
=marked= here, but ==doubled== is literal.
```

```html
<p><mark>marked</mark> here, but ==doubled== is literal.</p>
```

:::

`{~ … ~}` is editorial substitution when it contains a top-level `~>`, and forced strikethrough otherwise. `{= … =}` is forced highlight.

::: compare

```carve
re{~view~} it, then {~old~>new~}, and {=mark=} it.
```

```html
<p>re<s>view</s> it, then <del>old</del><ins>new</ins>, and <mark>mark</mark> it.</p>
```

:::

## Headings

::: compare

```carve
# Welcome
## Getting started
### Setup
```

```html
<section id="Welcome">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <section id="Getting-started">
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <section id="Setup">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
    </section>
  </section>
</section>
```

:::

All six heading levels are supported.

::: compare

```carve
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

```html
<section id="H1">
  <h1>H1</h1>
  <section id="H2">
    <h2>H2</h2>
    <section id="H3">
      <h3>H3</h3>
      <section id="H4">
        <h4>H4</h4>
        <section id="H5">
          <h5>H5</h5>
          <section id="H6">
            <h6>H6</h6>
          </section>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>
</section>
```

:::

Attributes attach to the heading via a block-attribute line on the line above (the uniform block rule, §15) — a heading line carries no trailing `{…}` block. The rendered attribute order matches the source order. An explicit `#id` hoists to the `<section>` wrapper.

::: compare

```carve
{#install .featured}
## Setup
```

```html
<section id="install">
  <h2 class="featured">Setup</h2>
</section>
```

:::

Inline emphasis renders inside heading text.

::: compare

```carve
## Why /Carve/?
```

```html
<section id="Why-Carve">
  <h2>Why <em>Carve</em>?</h2>
</section>
```

:::

A `#` at line start without a following space is a tag, not a heading. By
default it renders as a styled inline token, not an invented link target.

::: compare

```carve
#notaheading
```

```html
<p><span class="tag"><strong>#notaheading</strong></span></p>
```

:::

A heading that skips an intermediate level still nests by section: `# H1`
followed by `### H3` places H3's `<section>` inside H1's, and Carve does not
synthesize an intervening `<h2>`/`<section>` (§13 — the stack closes only
sections at level `>= N`).

::: compare

```carve
# H1

### H3

content
```

```html
<section id="H1">
  <h1>H1</h1>
  <section id="H3">
    <h3>H3</h3>
    <p>content</p>
  </section>
</section>
```

:::

## Links

::: compare

```carve
Read [Djot](https://djot.net) for details.
```

```html
<p>Read <a href="https://djot.net">Djot</a> for details.</p>
```

:::

A quoted title after the URL becomes the `title` attribute on the anchor.

::: compare

```carve
[Site](https://example.com "Hover text")
```

```html
<p><a href="https://example.com" title="Hover text">Site</a></p>
```

:::

Single-quoted titles work too (a deliberate enhancement over djot). A literal apostrophe in a rendered title is escaped to `&apos;`.

::: compare

```carve
[A](/a 'plain') and [B](/b "Bob's")
```

```html
<p><a href="/a" title="plain">A</a> and <a href="/b" title="Bob&apos;s">B</a></p>
```

:::

A backslash-escaped delimiter inside a title is a literal quote (CommonMark-style), so `\"` does not end a double-quoted title — it renders as a literal `"` (`&quot;`) in the `title` attribute (grammar `link_title`).

::: compare

```carve
[t](/url "ti\"tle")
```

```html
<p><a href="/url" title="ti&quot;tle">t</a></p>
```

:::

Autolinks use angle brackets and produce a self-titled anchor; bare email addresses get the `mailto:` scheme.

::: compare

```carve
Visit <https://example.com> or write <hello@example.com>.
```

```html
<p>Visit <a href="https://example.com">https://example.com</a> or write <a href="mailto:hello@example.com">hello@example.com</a>.</p>
```

:::

A trailing `{…}` block attaches attributes to an autolink.

::: compare

```carve
<https://example.com>{.ext}
```

```html
<p><a href="https://example.com" class="ext">https://example.com</a></p>
```

:::

Escaped brackets render as literals, no link is produced.

::: compare

```carve
\[not a link\](https://example.com)
```

```html
<p>[not a link](https://example.com)</p>
```

:::

An empty link text is allowed and produces an empty anchor — useful as a target for a styled link.

::: compare

```carve
[](https://example.com)
```

```html
<p><a href="https://example.com"></a></p>
```

:::

A bracketed run directly followed by an attribute block is an inline span (PART 9 §14): the attributes attach to a `<span>`.

::: compare

```carve
[some text]{.highlight #note key=val}
```

```html
<p><span class="highlight" id="note" key="val">some text</span></p>
```

:::

Span content is parsed recursively, and an inline link still wins over a span.

::: compare

```carve
[a /b/ c]{.x} and [t](u)
```

```html
<p><span class="x">a <em>b</em> c</span> and <a href="u">t</a></p>
```

:::

Links never nest. When a link's text contains another link, the inner link is replaced by its text and only the outer destination applies, so explicit nesting collapses to a single anchor.

::: compare

```carve
[[x](y)](z)
```

```html
<p><a href="z">x</a></p>
```

:::

The same rule covers an autolink that lands inside a link's text: the autolink becomes plain text, never a nested anchor.

::: compare

```carve
[pre <http://h> post](/u)
```

```html
<p><a href="/u">pre http://h post</a></p>
```

:::

It also covers a crossref, which only becomes a link once it resolves: inside a link's text it contributes its resolved text, not a second anchor.

::: compare

```carve
# H

[see </#H>](/outer)
```

```html
<section id="H">
  <h1>H</h1>
  <p><a href="/outer">see H</a></p>
</section>
```

:::

The rule is about link content in the parsed tree. One renderer-level case is out of scope: a footnote reference inside a link label still renders its own `doc-noteref` anchor inside the outer anchor. Putting a footnote inside a link is unusual, and the footnote body and endnote are unaffected.

## Images

::: compare

```carve
![Apollo 11](apollo.jpg)
```

```html
<img src="apollo.jpg" alt="Apollo 11">
```

:::

## Lists

::: compare

```carve
- apples
- oranges
- pears
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>apples</li>
  <li>oranges</li>
  <li>pears</li>
</ul>
```

:::

A marker is a list item only when followed by a space **and** content. A content-less marker — bare (`-`) or trailing whitespace only (`- `) — is not a list; it stays paragraph text. The rule ignores trailing whitespace, so `-` and `- ` behave the same (an editor stripping the space can't change the meaning). Carve is stricter than CommonMark, where a bare `-` is an empty item.

::: compare

```carve
-
not a list
```

```html
<p>-
not a list</p>
```

:::

Ordered lists use `N.` prefixes — numbering starts from the first marker.

::: compare

```carve
1. first
2. second
3. third
```

```html
<ol>
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
  <li>third</li>
</ol>
```

:::

Nested lists indent two spaces under the parent item.

::: compare

```carve
- fruit
  - apples
  - oranges
- vegetables
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>fruit
    <ul>
      <li>apples</li>
      <li>oranges</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>vegetables</li>
</ul>
```

:::

Lists can mix markers — an ordered list may contain a nested unordered list (and vice versa).

::: compare

```carve
1. setup
   - clone
   - install
2. build
```

```html
<ol>
  <li>setup
    <ul>
      <li>clone</li>
      <li>install</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>build</li>
</ol>
```

:::

An ordered list nests the same way — a child indented to the parent's content column (three spaces under `1. `) is a sub-list, even though an ordered marker does not interrupt a paragraph (§10).

::: compare

```carve
1. outer
   1. inner
```

```html
<ol>
  <li>outer
    <ol>
      <li>inner</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
```

:::

An ordered child *below* the content column does not nest: an ordered marker does not interrupt a paragraph (§10), so it folds into the item as lazy text.

::: compare

```carve
1. outer
  1. inner
```

```html
<ol>
  <li>outer
1. inner</li>
</ol>
```

:::

A task item's content column is the bullet width (2), since the checkbox is content, not marker, so a child indented to column 2 nests. A marker indented below the content column folds in as lazy continuation rather than nesting; no list marker interrupts (§10), so only a marker at or past the content column opens a sub-list.

::: compare

```carve
- [ ] outer
  - inner
```

```html
<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> outer
    <ul>
      <li>inner</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

:::

A list marker does not interrupt an open paragraph — like an ordered marker, a bullet needs a blank line before it. An indented bullet after a prose line folds into the paragraph (lazy continuation).

::: compare

```carve
text
  - item
```

```html
<p>text
- item</p>
```

:::

With no preceding paragraph, an indented bullet simply opens a list whose base column is the indentation (Rule B).

::: compare

```carve
  - a
  - b
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>a</li>
  <li>b</li>
</ul>
```

:::

A blank line between items produces a loose list — each item wraps in a paragraph.

::: compare

```carve
- apples

- oranges
```

```html
<ul>
  <li><p>apples</p></li>
  <li><p>oranges</p></li>
</ul>
```

:::

A paragraph ends at a blank line — or at a line that begins an interrupting
block. A continuation line that starts with `>`, a valid `|…|` table row, a
heading `#`, a thematic break, or a fence with a closer interrupts the
paragraph and starts that block, with no blank line required (the
Markdown-like rule; §10). A **list marker is the exception**: neither a
bullet (`- ` / `* `) nor an ordered marker (`1.`, `1)`, `a.`, …) interrupts —
a list needs a blank line before it (symmetric, Djot-like). So a
hard-wrapped prose line that happens to begin with a bullet stays prose; the
bullet lines fold into the paragraph as lazy continuation.

::: compare

```carve
Die Frage ist x = 5
* 3 + 17 wahr.
```

```html
<p>Die Frage ist x = 5
* 3 + 17 wahr.</p>
```

:::

A heading under a prose line still interrupts it; a list — bullet or
ordered — does not, so these fold into one paragraph.

::: compare

```carve
Liste:
- eins
- zwei
```

```html
<p>Liste:
- eins
- zwei</p>
```

:::

A blank line before the marker makes it a list, even with one item.

::: compare

```carve
Text hier

- nur eins
```

```html
<p>Text hier</p>
<ul>
  <li>nur eins</li>
</ul>
```

:::

Tight nesting is unaffected by the paragraph rule: an indented marker inside an
open list item opens a sublist with no blank line, so a one-child nested list
still nests.

::: compare

```carve
- parent
  - child
```

```html
<ul>
  <li>parent
    <ul>
      <li>child</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
```

:::

A blockquote needs a blank line before it like any block; its caption line
then attaches and the pair renders as a figure.

::: compare

```carve
Intro

> Stay hungry
^ Steve Jobs
```

```html
<p>Intro</p>
<figure>
  <blockquote><p>Stay hungry</p></blockquote>
  <figcaption>Steve Jobs</figcaption>
</figure>
```

:::

After a lazy continuation line, a marker at the content column resumes the *same* sub-list rather than starting a new one (§10).

::: compare

```carve
1. outer
   1. inner
lazy
   2. sibling
```

```html
<ol>
  <li>outer
    <ol>
      <li>inner
lazy</li>
      <li>sibling</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
```

:::

## Task lists

::: compare

```carve
- [ ] todo
- [x] done
```

```html
<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> todo</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> done</li>
</ul>
```

:::

Only `[x]`/`[X]` render a checked box; every other state (`[ ]`, `[-]`, `[_]`, `[>]`, `[?]`) renders an unchecked box.

::: compare

```carve
- [-] dropped
- [_] paused
- [>] deferred
- [?] maybe
```

```html
<ul>
  <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> dropped</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> paused</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> deferred</li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" disabled> maybe</li>
</ul>
```

```carve

```html
<figure>

## Image with caption

::: compare

```carve

^ Figure 1: First moon landing
```

```html
<figure>
  <img src="apollo.jpg" alt="Apollo 11">
  <figcaption>Figure 1: First moon landing</figcaption>
</figure>
```

:::

A trailing attribute block is the **image's** attribute, so it stays on the
`<img>` even when the image is wrapped in a `<figure>`, the same target as a
standalone block image. To attribute the `<figure>` instead, use a preceding
block-attribute line, which floats onto the outer block (§15).

::: compare

```carve
![Apollo 11](apollo.jpg){.hero}
^ Figure 1: First moon landing

```html
<figure>

Single-column tables follow the same rules — one `|=` cell yields the header row.

::: compare

```carve

```

```html
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Heading</th></tr></thead>

    <tr><td>Row 2</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

:::

A GFM-style separator row (the second row, all dashes with optional alignment colons) is also accepted: it makes the first row the header and sets per-column alignment.

::: compare

```carve
| Name | Age |
|:-----|----:|
| Alice | 28  |
```

```html
<table>
  <thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;">Name</th><th style="text-align: right;">Age</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td style="text-align: left;">Alice</td><td style="text-align: right;">28</td></tr>
  </tbody>

```

:::

An escaped pipe inside cell content (`\|`) renders as a literal `|` and does not split the cell.

::: compare

```carve

| \|      | pipe char |
```

```html
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Meaning</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>|</td><td>pipe char</td></tr>
  </tbody>

```

:::

Empty cells produce empty `<td>` elements — placement is preserved, not collapsed.

::: compare

```carve

| 1  |    | 3  |
```

```html
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>1</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr>
  </tbody>

```

:::

Inline emphasis applies inside cells just like in paragraphs.

::: compare

```carve
|= Style    |= Sample      |
| italic    | /soft/        |
| strong    | *firm*        |
| code      | `literal`     |
```

```html

  <tbody>
    <tr><td>italic</td><td><em>soft</em></td></tr>
    <tr><td>strong</td><td><strong>firm</strong></td></tr>
    <tr><td>code</td><td><code>literal</code></td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

:::

A `|=` cell in a body row is a row header: it renders as `<th>` inside `<tbody>` while the row stays a body row. This expresses row headers (a leading first-column `<th>` per data row), which a separator row cannot. The thead is still only the leading all-header rows.

::: compare

```carve
|=         |= Diameter (km) |= Size vs Earth |
|= Mercury | 4,879.4         | 38%            |

    <tr><th>Venus</th><td>12,104</td><td>95%</td></tr>

:::

With no leading header row, every first cell can still be a row header — the table has no `<thead>` at all.

## Fenced code

::: compare

````carve
```python
print("hi")
```
````

```html
<pre><code class="language-python">print("hi")
</code></pre>
```

:::

Literal tabs in code content are preserved verbatim (a tab is not the same as spaces; display width is a CSS `tab-size` concern). Opt in to tab→space expansion with a tab-normalize extension.

::: compare

````carve
```
	indented with a tab
```
````

```html
<pre><code>	indented with a tab
</code></pre>
```

:::

A fenced block with no info string renders without a language class.

::: compare

````carve
```
plain text
```
````

```html
<pre><code>plain text
</code></pre>
```

:::

A code fence carries no inline attributes — the info string is just the language. Attributes on a code block use the standard preceding `{…}` block-attribute line; they render on the `<pre>` (the language stays `language-…` on the `<code>`).

::: compare

````carve
{.fancy #x}
```php
code
```
````

```html
<pre class="fancy" id="x"><code class="language-php">code
</code></pre>
```

:::

The info string may carry a bracketed `[label]` after the language (or a bare `[label]` with no language). The label is structured metadata — it is **not** part of the language class; the core renderer ignores it, and an extension (e.g. a code-group) may use it.

::: compare

````carve
```php [NPM]
npm install x
```
````

```html
<pre><code class="language-php">npm install x
</code></pre>
```

:::

A quoted `"header"` after the language (and before any `[label]`) sets a human-visible title for the block. Because a code block's `<pre><code>` holds atomic preformatted text, the header cannot be a child element the way an admonition title is — core carries it as the `title` attribute on the `<pre>`, and the host decides whether to render a filename bar or leave it as the native mouseover tooltip. It uses the same quoted-title token as an admonition header, but because it targets an attribute the text is literal (not inline-parsed), only HTML-escaped — so markup-like characters in a filename survive.

::: compare

````carve
```php "src/Auth.php"
$ok = true;
```
````

```html
<pre title="src/Auth.php"><code class="language-php">$ok = true;
</code></pre>
```

:::

A header and a `[label]` may combine, in that fixed order. The label stays inert in core (a code-group would use it as the tab name); the header still becomes the `title`.

::: compare

````carve
```php "src/Auth.php" [Composer]
composer require x
```
````

```html
<pre title="src/Auth.php"><code class="language-php">composer require x
</code></pre>
```

:::

A header may appear with no language, leaving the `<code>` unclassed.

::: compare

````carve
``` "notes.txt"
remember the milk
```
````

```html
<pre title="notes.txt"><code>remember the milk
</code></pre>
```

:::

The header text is literal — markup-like characters (a glob `*`, an underscore) are not parsed, so a filename survives intact in the `title`.

::: compare

````carve
```js "*.config.js"
export default {}
```
````

```html
<pre title="*.config.js"><code class="language-js">export default {}
</code></pre>
```

:::

If the preceding `{…}` block-attribute line also sets `title`, that line wins — the opener header only fills `title` when the attribute line did not.

::: compare

````carve
{title="from the attribute line"}
```php "from the header"
code
```
````

```html
<pre title="from the attribute line"><code class="language-php">code
</code></pre>
```

:::

Anything else after the language token — a bare second word, a `key="value"` pair, an inline `{…}` block, or a header and label in the wrong order — is **not** a fenced code block. There is no error: the backtick run falls back to ordinary inline parsing (an inline code span). Quotes and brackets are the only delimiters that admit metadata, and only in the order header-then-label.

::: compare

`````carve
```js title="x"
code
```
`````

```html
<p><code>js title="x"
code

Tildes are an alternative fence — useful when the body contains backtick fences.

::: compare

```carve
~~~yaml

```

```html
<pre><code class="language-yaml">key: value

```

:::

Lengthening the fence lets a code block embed a literal triple-backtick fence as content.

::: compare

`````html
<pre><code class="language-markdown">```python

:::

Code-block content is never parsed for Carve syntax — emphasis, headings, and tags inside are literal.

::: compare

````carve
```
# not a heading
/not italic/  *not bold*  #notatag

````

```html
<pre><code># not a heading

## Inline code

::: compare

```carve
Run `npm install` first.

```html
<p>Run <code>npm install</code> first.</p>
```

:::

Use a longer run of backticks to embed a literal backtick inside the span.

::: compare

```carve
The literal `` ` `` is one backtick.
```

```html
<p>The literal <code>`</code> is one backtick.</p>
```

:::

Carve syntax inside a code span is never parsed — it renders as literal text.

::: compare

```carve
The string `*not bold*` is literal.
```

```html
<p>The string <code>*not bold*</code> is literal.</p>
```

:::

A pipe inside an inline code span does not split the surrounding table cell.

::: compare

```carve
Use `ls | grep foo` to filter.
```

```html
<p>Use <code>ls | grep foo</code> to filter.</p>
```

:::

The opener is a maximal run of backticks and closes only on a run of the same length. A run with no matching closer is not literal text: it opens a verbatim span that runs to the end of the block. (A fence-looking ` ``` ` mid-paragraph is the common case.)

::: compare

````carve
text
```
code
````

````html
<p>text
<code>
code</code></p>
````

:::

An unclosed run is opaque: an emphasis delimiter or link tail after it is verbatim content, so the surrounding construct never closes.

::: compare

```carve
*a ` b*
```

```html
<p>*a <code> b*</code></p>
```

:::

## Attributes

::: compare

```carve
{.large #intro}
# Title

A paragraph with [a styled link](url){.btn .primary}.
```

```html
<section id="intro">
  <h1 class="large">Title</h1>
  <p>A paragraph with <a href="url" class="btn primary">a styled link</a>.</p>
</section>
```

:::

An inline `{...}` attaches to the preceding inline node — including an inline code span. (The `{=html}` / `{=latex}` raw-inline form is a separate rule.)

::: compare

```carve
`code`{.cls}
```

```html
<p><code class="cls">code</code></p>
```

:::

A `{...}` line on its own attaches to the next block (PART 9 §15).

::: compare

```carve
{.note}
This paragraph gets the class.
```

```html
<p class="note">This paragraph gets the class.</p>
```

:::

Consecutive attribute lines merge, and classes accumulate in source order.

::: compare

```carve
{.a}
{.b}
Merged.
```

```html
<p class="a b">Merged.</p>
```

:::

Block attributes attach to any block — here, a list.

::: compare

```carve
{.todo}
- one
- two
```

```html
<ul class="todo">
  <li>one</li>
  <li>two</li>
</ul>
```

:::

Attributes render in the order written in the source — classes merge into one `class` at the first class's position (PART 9 attributes rule).

::: compare

```carve
[label]{key=c .a #b}
```

```html
<p><span key="c" class="a" id="b">label</span></p>
```

:::

## Frontmatter

::: compare

```carve
---
title: My Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2026-03-15
---

Content begins here.
```

```html
<p>Content begins here.</p>
```

:::

The opening delimiter may name the metadata format (`---yaml`, `---json`, `---toml`, `---neon`, …); a bare `---` defaults to YAML. Either way the frontmatter is metadata, not rendered. The closing delimiter is always a bare `---`.

::: compare

```carve
---json
{"title": "My Document"}
---

Content begins here.
```

```html
<p>Content begins here.</p>
```

:::

The space between `---` and the format token is optional — `---toml` and `--- toml` are both accepted (the no-space form is canonical), matching code fences: ` ```php ` is canonical, though a space after the fence is accepted for compatibility.

::: compare

```carve
--- toml
title = "My Document"
---

Content begins here.
```

```html
<p>Content begins here.</p>
```

:::

## Heading IDs

Heading ids are **case-preserving** by default and apply no Unicode
normalization: a heading keeps its original case and any non-ASCII characters
verbatim. Cross-references resolve **case-insensitively**, so a lowercase
`</#getting-started>` still points at a `Getting-Started` heading.

::: compare

```carve
# Café Notes

# Über uns

# 2024 Recap

## Setup

## Setup

{#api-v2}
# API

See </#cafe-notes>, </#section-2024-recap>, </#setup-2>, and </#api-v2>.
```

```html
<section id="Café-Notes">
  <h1>Café Notes</h1>
</section>
<section id="Über-uns">
  <h1>Über uns</h1>
</section>
<section id="s-2024-Recap">
  <h1>2024 Recap</h1>
  <section id="Setup">
    <h2>Setup</h2>
  </section>
  <section id="Setup-2">
    <h2>Setup</h2>
  </section>
</section>
<section id="api-v2">
  <h1>API</h1>
  <p>See &lt;/#cafe-notes&gt;, &lt;/#section-2024-recap&gt;, <a href="#Setup-2">Setup</a>, and <a href="#api-v2">API</a>.</p>
</section>
```

:::

A cross-reference matches its target case-insensitively and links to the
target's actual (case-preserved) id, so the reference can be written in
lowercase regardless of how the heading is capitalized.

::: compare

```carve
# Getting Started

Jump to </#getting-started>.
```

```html
<section id="Getting-Started">
  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>Jump to <a href="#Getting-Started">Getting Started</a>.</p>
</section>
```

:::

Non-ASCII symbols, marks, and punctuation are kept verbatim; only runs of
ASCII non-alphanumerics collapse to a single hyphen.

::: compare

```carve
# Café Crème

# Hello • World

# 中文、标题
```

```html
<section id="Café-Crème">
  <h1>Café Crème</h1>
</section>
<section id="Hello-•-World">
  <h1>Hello • World</h1>
</section>
<section id="中文、标题">
  <h1>中文、标题</h1>
</section>
```

:::

Smart-typography substitutions (curly quotes, dashes, ellipsis, arrows, and
the like) are reversed to their ASCII source before the id is computed, so an
id never depends on presentational typography.

::: compare

```carve
# Don't repeat yourself

# Step 1 -> done...
```

```html
<section id="Don-t-repeat-yourself">
  <h1>Don’t repeat yourself</h1>
</section>
<section id="Step-1-done">
  <h1>Step 1 → done…</h1>
</section>
```

:::

A slug that begins with any Unicode number (Arabic-Indic digits, superscripts,
Roman numerals) is prefixed with `s-`, because a leading digit is a valid HTML
id but not a bare CSS selector.

::: compare

```carve
# ١٢٣ heading

# ²super

# Ⅷ chapter
```

```html
<section id="s-١٢٣-heading">
  <h1>١٢٣ heading</h1>
</section>
<section id="s-²super">
  <h1>²super</h1>
</section>
<section id="s-Ⅷ-chapter">
  <h1>Ⅷ chapter</h1>
</section>
```

:::

A heading whose text yields no identifier characters falls back to `s`.

::: compare

```carve
# ( )
```

```html
<section id="s">
  <h1>( )</h1>
</section>
```

:::

## Reference link

`[text][label]` resolves against a `[label]: url "title"` definition
anywhere in the document (order-independent). The definition line
itself produces no output.

::: compare

```carve
Read the [introduction][intro] first.

[intro]: https://example.com/intro "Introduction"
```

```html
<p>Read the <a href="https://example.com/intro" title="Introduction">introduction</a> first.</p>
```

:::

A trailing attribute block attaches to the resolved `<a>`, the same slot an
inline link uses (grammar `reference_link`).

::: compare

```carve
Read the [intro][x]{.ext} first.

[x]: /intro
```

```html
<p>Read the <a href="/intro" class="ext">intro</a> first.</p>
```

:::

"Anywhere in the document" includes inside a container: a reference definition
written inside a blockquote or a list item is still an invisible block that is
collected into the document-wide definition table, so a reference elsewhere
resolves against it. The container keeps only its visible content (here, none).

::: compare

```carve
> [ref]: /url

See [it][ref].
```

```html
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="/url">it</a>.</p>
```

:::

::: compare

```carve
- [ref]: /url

See [it][ref].
```

```html
<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="/url">it</a>.</p>
```

:::

A reference definition shares the `link_destination` rule, so its URL ends at
the **first whitespace**: everything after the first space is ignored (it is not
a title unless it is a quoted run). So `[r]: a b c` resolves the label to `a`.

::: compare

```carve
[r][r]

[r]: a b c
```

```html
<p><a href="a">r</a></p>
```

:::

A quoted run after the destination is still parsed as the title, exactly as in
an inline link.

::: compare

```carve
[r][r]

[r]: /url "Title"
```

```html
<p><a href="/url" title="Title">r</a></p>
```

:::

A backslash-escaped quote inside the title is a literal quote, exactly as in an inline link title (`link_title`). The escaped `\"` does not end the quoted run; it renders as a literal `"` (`&quot;`) in the `title` attribute.

::: compare

```carve
[x][y]

[y]: /u "a\"b\"c"
```

```html
<p><a href="/u" title="a&quot;b&quot;c">x</a></p>
```

:::

A reference definition requires a non-empty destination (grammar `reference_definition`). A `[r]:` with nothing after the colon — or only trailing whitespace — is **not** a definition; the line stays literal text.

::: compare

```carve
[r]:
```

```html
<p>[r]:</p>
```

:::

Trailing whitespace after the colon does not create a destination either, so it is still literal.

::: compare

```carve
[r]:   
```

```html
<p>[r]:</p>
```

:::

## Collapsed reference link

`[text][]` uses the link text as the label.

::: compare

```carve
See [Other Page][] for details.

[Other Page]: /other-page
```

```html
<p>See <a href="/other-page">Other Page</a> for details.</p>
```

:::

A trailing attribute block attaches to the resolved `<a>` here too
(grammar `collapsed_reference_link`).

::: compare

```carve
See [Other][]{.ext} for details.

[Other]: /other
```

```html
<p>See <a href="/other" class="ext">Other</a> for details.</p>
```

:::

## Unresolved reference link

A reference with no matching definition renders as literal text.

::: compare

```carve
A [missing][nope] ref stays literal.
```

```html
<p>A [missing][nope] ref stays literal.</p>
```

:::

## Smart typography dashes and quotes

`--` `---` `...` become en/em dashes and ellipsis; straight quotes
become contextual curly quotes.

::: compare

```carve
He paused -- then ran --- fast... "Stop!" it's over.
```

```html
<p>He paused – then ran — fast… “Stop!” it’s over.</p>
```

:::

A quote opens (left/opening quote) when it follows start-of-content, whitespace (incl. NBSP), or one of the opening/operator characters `( [ { = : - /`; otherwise it closes. So a quote right after `=`, `:`, `-`, `/`, or an opening paren still opens the first quote (grammar `smart_quote`).

::: compare

```carve
a="b"
:"q"
-"q"
/"q"
("q")
```

```html
<p>a=“b”
:“q”
-“q”
/“q”
(“q”)</p>
```

:::

When a quote does **not** follow one of those opening contexts it closes instead — so a quote right after a closing bracket (`}` `)` `]`), after sentence punctuation (`.` `,`), or mid-word always becomes a right/closing quote. An empty `""` opens both marks (the second `"` follows a `"`, which is not an opening context, yet there is nothing to its right to close against, so it too renders as an opening quote).

::: compare

```carve
}"q"
)"q"
]"q"
."q"
,"q"
a"b
""
```

```html
<p>}”q”
)”q”
]”q”
.”q”
,”q”
a”b
””</p>
```

:::

The same opening set applies to the single quote `'`. After `(`, `[`, `=`, `:`, `-`, or `/` a single quote opens (`‘`); the matching `'` then closes (`’`).

::: compare

```carve
('q')
['q']
='q'
:'q'
-'q'
/'q'
```

```html
<p>(‘q’)
[‘q’]
=‘q’
:‘q’
-‘q’
/‘q’</p>
```

:::

A single quote after `{` opens too — shown on its own line because a trailing `{…}` would otherwise be read as an attribute block.

::: compare

```carve
{'q'}
```

```html
<p>{‘q’}</p>
```

:::

A single quote before a digit is an apostrophe (decade elision), so a digit pair becomes apostrophes on both sides; a quote before a letter in an open context opens.

::: compare

```carve
the '70s and '24' and 'word'
```

```html
<p>the ’70s and ’24’ and ‘word’</p>
```

:::

A run of four or more hyphens is allocated into em/en dashes (all em if divisible by 3, all en if by 2, otherwise max em-dashes with an en remainder) — matching djot.

::: compare

```carve
a---- b----- c------
```

```html
<p>a–– b—– c——</p>
```

:::

## Smart typography arrows and symbols

Arrows, comparisons, plus/minus and symbols are converted. Fractions are
intentionally **not** converted (they collide with dates and paths; see
`docs/dismissed-syntax.md`).

::: compare

```carve
Flow: a -> b <- c <-> d => e; x != y, p <= q, r >= s, +-1.
(c) 2024, (r), (tm). Dates like 1/2/2024 stay literal.
```

```html
<p>Flow: a → b ← c ↔ d ⇒ e; x ≠ y, p ≤ q, r ≥ s, ±1.
© 2024, ®, ™. Dates like 1/2/2024 stay literal.</p>
```

:::

## Math

Inline math is `` $`…` `` and display math `` $$`…` ``. Wrapping the
content in a backtick span removes any ambiguity with a literal `$`, so
currency stays literal. The output matches djot.

::: compare

```carve
Inline $`E = mc^2` and currency $5 stays literal.

$$`\int_0^1 x\,dx`
```

```html
<p>Inline <span class="math inline">\(E = mc^2\)</span> and currency $5 stays literal.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\int_0^1 x\,dx\]</span></p>
```

:::

A trailing attribute block applies to the math span, merging classes into the
existing `math inline` / `math display` class (math reuses the code-span
attribute slot). The `{=format}` raw form is code-span-only and is not inherited
by math: `` $`x`{=html} `` leaves the `{=html}` literal.

::: compare

```carve
$`a^2`{.boxed #eq1 data-k=v}
```

```html
<p><span class="math inline boxed" id="eq1" data-k="v">\(a^2\)</span></p>
```

:::

## Footnotes

A `[^label]` reference is numbered by document order; its `[^label]: …`
definition renders in an endnotes section with a backlink, using djot's
`doc-noteref` / `doc-endnotes` / `doc-backlink` roles.

::: compare

```carve
Carve has footnotes.[^fn]

[^fn]: Defined anywhere; resolved by label.
```

```html
<p>Carve has footnotes.<a id="fnref1" href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
```

:::

A reference definition is invisible metadata, so it still ends the paragraph
even with no blank line (§10); indented lines continue the note body.

::: compare

```carve
See the note[^m].
[^m]: First line of the note
   and a continuation line.
```

```html
<p>See the note<a id="fnref1" href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

and a continuation line.<a href="#fnref1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
```

:::

A footnote definition that is never referenced produces no endnotes section.

::: compare

```carve
text
[^f]: note
```

```html
<p>text</p>

:::

A trailing attribute block on a reference attaches to the noteref `<a>`
(grammar PART 9 §16). Only the reference where the author wrote the block
carries it.

::: compare

```carve
Text[^a]{.ref}.

[^a]: note.
```

```html

    <li id="fn1">
      <p>note.<a href="#fnref1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
```

:::

A note referenced more than once gets a distinct `fnref` id per reference and one numbered backlink per reference (`↩` with a superscript), so each return arrow points back to its own reference. (A note referenced once keeps a plain `↩`.)

::: compare

```carve
See[^m] and again[^m].

[^m]: One note, two refs.
```

```html
<p>See<a id="fnref1" href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and again<a id="fnref1-2" href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>

    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
```

:::

## Inline footnotes

An inline footnote `^[content]` carries its note text in place (pandoc-style),
with no separate definition. It is numbered into the same endnotes section as a
reference footnote, interleaved by document order, and its content is inline
(§16). A caret immediately before `[` opens the note; any other caret is
literal text (there is no bare superscript). `^[x]^` is therefore a note plus
a literal `^`, `^^[x]` is a literal `^` plus a note, and `\^[x]` is literal.

::: compare

```carve
A note^[see *later*] inline. And a ref[^a].

[^a]: reference body.
```

```html
<p>A note<a id="fnref1" href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> inline. And a ref<a id="fnref2" href="#fn2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

      <p>reference body.<a href="#fnref2" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>

A trailing attribute block attaches to the noteref `<a>`, like a reference
footnote (§16).

::: compare

```carve
Text^[note]{.ref}.

## Generic divs

A bare `:::` opener with no type word is djot's generic container: a plain
`<div>` (a typed `::: word` is a two-tier admonition/div instead). The
fence line carries no inline attributes (strict djot); to attribute a div,
put a `{…}` block-attribute line before the opener, which floats onto it.

:::: compare

```carve
:::
A plain box.
:::

{#s .sidebar}
:::
A div with attributes.
:::
```

```html
<div>
  <p>A plain box.</p>
</div>
<div id="s" class="sidebar">
  <p>A div with attributes.</p>
</div>
```

::::

An inline attribute block on the fence line is **not** a div: the opener is
an ordinary paragraph (matching canonical djot).

:::: compare

```carve
::: {.sidebar}
not a div
:::
```

```html
<p>::: {.sidebar}
not a div
:::</p>
```

::::

The type word is a grammar identifier, so it may start with an underscore.

:::: compare

```carve
::: _box
content
:::
```

```html
<div class="_box">
  <p>content</p>
</div>
```

::::

A grammar identifier cannot start with a digit, so a digit-first token is
not a valid type word: the opener is an ordinary paragraph (a `class="123"`
would also be invalid CSS). This is a deliberate divergence from djot,
which would accept it.

:::: compare

```carve
::: 123
not a div
:::
```

```html
<p>::: 123
not a div
:::</p>
```

::::

## Definition lists

`:: term` (one or more) then `:  definition` (one or more) form an entry,
rendered as a `<dl>` of `<dt>` then `<dd>`. Two colons is a term; three
is a div/admonition.

::: compare

```carve
:: color
:: colour
:  The visual property of objects.
:  A pigment or paint.
```

```html
<dl>
  <dt>color</dt>
  <dt>colour</dt>
  <dd>The visual property of objects.</dd>
  <dd>A pigment or paint.</dd>
</dl>
```

:::

A definition continues exactly like a list item. An indented block after a
blank line folds into the definition, so a `<dd>` can hold more than one
paragraph:

::: compare

```carve
:: term
:  A definition can now hold

   more than one paragraph.
```

```html
<dl>
  <dt>term</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A definition can now hold</p>
    <p>more than one paragraph.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
```

:::

A lone `+` is the continuation marker (the same one lists and block quotes
use): it attaches the following flush-left block to the definition with no
indentation.

::: compare

```carve
:: term
:  A first paragraph,
+
then a flush-left block joined with +.
```

```html
<dl>
  <dt>term</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A first paragraph,</p>
    <p>then a flush-left block joined with +.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
```

:::

A flush-left line with no blank before it lazily continues the open definition
paragraph, exactly as it would inside a list item (and as in djot). A blank
line, a new marker, or a block opener ends the definition instead.

::: compare

```carve
:: term
:  A definition wrapped
onto the next line.
```

```html
<dl>
  <dt>term</dt>
  <dd>A definition wrapped
onto the next line.</dd>
</dl>
```

:::

When the definition's sole content is a lone `+`, it opens a *first block*: the
body is the following flush-left block, with no indentation - the same opener
the list form `- +` provides. Write `:  \+` for a literal `+`.

::: compare

```carve
:: term
:  +
> the whole definition is this quote
```

```html
<dl>
  <dt>term</dt>
  <dd>
    <blockquote><p>the whole definition is this quote</p></blockquote>
  </dd>
</dl>
```

:::

The **term** side is inline-only, like a heading label: it holds inline content
(no block content), but it *does* fold a following plain line into the term
with a soft break - a wrapped term line joins the term instead of ending the
list. A new marker (`::` / `:  `), a blank line, or a block opener ends the
term.

::: compare

```carve
:: A term that
wraps onto the next line
:  its definition
```

```html
<dl>
  <dt>A term that
wraps onto the next line</dt>
  <dd>its definition</dd>
</dl>
```

:::

A definition list also does **not** interrupt a paragraph - a `::` line
directly under prose folds into that paragraph, so a list needs a blank line
before it.

A blank line may separate a term from its definition (or one definition from
the next) for readability - a following `:  ` line still attaches to the entry:

::: compare

```carve
:: term

:  the definition
```

```html
<dl>
  <dt>term</dt>
  <dd>the definition</dd>
</dl>
```

:::

A definition (`<dd>`) ends at a blank line that is followed by neither an
indented continuation nor a `:  ` definition, at a new `::` term, or at a block
opener.

Attributes attach to the **whole `<dl>`** via a preceding block-attribute line
(`{.class}` on the line before the first `:: term`). There is deliberately no
per-`<dt>` / per-`<dd>` attribute form: unlike a list item (`-{.c}`) or a table
row (`| … |{.c}`), a term or definition takes no glued marker attributes. Style
individual terms/definitions with CSS descendant selectors (`dl.gloss dt`), or
put the attributes on the `<dl>`.

## Comments

`%%` starts a line comment and a `%%%` fence a block comment; neither is
rendered.

::: compare

```carve
Visible.

%% this line is a comment

%%%
a hidden
block
%%%

Also visible.
```

```html
<p>Visible.</p>
<p>Also visible.</p>
```

:::

A trailing `%%` (preceded by a space or at the start of the line) comments out
the rest of the physical line. The visible prefix is kept; the comment is not
rendered.

::: compare

```carve
Also visible. %% this tail is a comment
```

```html
<p>Also visible.</p>
```

:::

Without a space before it, `%%` is literal - so percentages and `a%%b` are safe.

::: compare

```carve
50%% off and a%%b stay literal.
```

```html
<p>50%% off and a%%b stay literal.</p>
```

:::

`%%` inside a code span is verbatim.

::: compare

```carve
Run `a %% b` then done. %% gone
```

```html
<p>Run <code>a %% b</code> then done.</p>
```

:::

A trailing comment works in a heading; it does not affect the generated id.

::: compare

```carve
# Title %% editor note
```

```html
<section id="Title">
  <h1>Title</h1>
</section>
```

:::

A trailing comment ends at the line break; the next line of the paragraph stays.

::: compare

```carve
foo %% note
bar
```

```html
<p>foo
bar</p>
```

:::

Leading whitespace before `%%` does not matter: an indented line whose first
non-whitespace content is `%%` is a line comment, exactly like one in the first
column. It renders nothing and, like any block, interrupts an open paragraph.

::: compare

```carve
x
  %% indented comment
y
```

```html
<p>x</p>
<p>y</p>
```

:::

An indented comment-only line on its own renders nothing (it does not leave an
empty paragraph).

::: compare

```carve
before

  %% indented comment

after
```

```html
<p>before</p>
<p>after</p>
```

:::

Tooling (`carve fmt --stamp`) may append a *provenance marker* - a trailing
comment recording the spec version a document was processed under and the engine
that wrote it. It is an ordinary comment, so it renders nothing; it is
deterministic (no timestamp) and tool-managed (replaced in place, not
hand-written).

::: compare

```carve
Hello.

%% carve-version: 0.1; generated-by: carve-js 0.1.0
```

```html
<p>Hello.</p>
```

:::

## Raw blocks

A ` ```=FORMAT ` block (a code fence whose info string is `=FORMAT`) passes its
content through verbatim when FORMAT matches the output; other formats are
dropped. This is the block parallel of the inline raw `{=format}` attribute.

::: compare

````carve
```=html
<custom-el>Verbatim HTML</custom-el>
```
````

````html
<custom-el>Verbatim HTML</custom-el>
````

:::

## Hard line breaks

A backslash at the end of a line forces a `<br>`.

::: compare

```carve
line one\
line two
```

```html
<p>line one<br>
line two</p>
```

:::

## Non-breaking space

A backslash before a space produces a non-breaking space.

::: compare

```carve
10\ kg
```

```html
<p>10&nbsp;kg</p>
```

:::

A non-breaking space counts as whitespace for smart-quote flanking, so a quote that follows one opens (exactly as it would after an ordinary space).

::: compare

```carve
say\ 'twas a fine\ "day"
```

```html
<p>say&nbsp;‘twas a fine&nbsp;“day”</p>
```

:::

The non-breaking space U+00A0 serializes as `&nbsp;` in text and code-span
output. (In a heading `id` it is kept as the raw byte instead - ids are not
entity-encoded; see *Heading IDs*.)

::: compare

```carve
`a b`
```

```html
<p><code>a&nbsp;b</code></p>
```

:::

## Raw inline

A verbatim span tagged `{=format}` passes through when the format
matches the output; otherwise it is dropped.

::: compare

```carve
Use `<br>`{=html} to break, and `\foo`{=latex} is dropped.
```

```html
<p>Use <br> to break, and  is dropped.</p>
```

:::

## Ordered list start and delimiter

An ordered list that begins above 1 emits `start`; the `)` delimiter is
accepted (and a delimiter change starts a new list).

::: compare

```carve
3. third
4. fourth
```

```html
<ol start="3">
  <li>third</li>
  <li>fourth</li>
</ol>
```

:::

::: compare

```carve
1) one
2) two
```

```html
<ol>
  <li>one</li>
  <li>two</li>
</ol>
```

:::

## Ordered list dialects

Alphabetic (`a.`/`A.`) and roman (`i.`/`I.`) markers set the `<ol type>`;
the first item fixes the dialect and `start`.

::: compare

```carve
a. apple
b. banana
```

```html
<ol type="a">
  <li>apple</li>
  <li>banana</li>
</ol>
```

:::

::: compare

```carve
iv. four
v. five
vi. six
```

```html
<ol type="i" start="4">
  <li>four</li>
  <li>five</li>
  <li>six</li>
</ol>
```

:::

## Editorial markup

CriticMarkup-style review marks: insert, delete, substitute, and an inline
comment. The `{~ … ~}` pair is substitution only when it contains a top-level
`~>`; without it, it is forced strikethrough (see Forced intraword emphasis).
`{# … #}` is the comment (no collision — `#` is not an emphasis delimiter).

::: compare

```carve
a {+ins+} {-del-} {~old~>new~} b{# note #}
```

```html
<p>a <ins>ins</ins> <del>del</del> <del>old</del><ins>new</ins> b<span class="critic-comment"> note </span></p>
```

:::

`{=text=}` is forced highlight (`<mark>`), and bare highlight is single-char
`=`. The raw-inline format attribute has its own shape — `{=html}` (no trailing
`=` before `}`) on a code span is raw passthrough, distinct from the
forced-highlight `{=text=}`.

::: compare

```carve
=x= and {=y=} both mark.
```

```html
<p><mark>x</mark> and <mark>y</mark> both mark.</p>
```

:::

## Thematic breaks

A line of three or more `-`, `*`, or `_` is a thematic break.

::: compare

```carve
a

---

b

***

c

___
```

```html
<p>a</p>
<hr>
<p>b</p>
<hr>
<p>c</p>
<hr>
```

:::

## Cross-reference

`</#id>` links to a heading and fills in its text (here, standalone).

::: compare

```carve
# Getting Started

See </#getting-started>.
```

```html
<section id="Getting-Started">
  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>See <a href="#Getting-Started">Getting Started</a>.</p>
</section>
```

:::

## Autolinks

A `<url>` or `<email>` in angle brackets becomes a self-titled link;
email gets a `mailto:` scheme.

::: compare

```carve
<https://example.com> and <a@b.com>
```

```html
<p><a href="https://example.com">https://example.com</a> and <a href="mailto:a@b.com">a@b.com</a></p>
```

:::

The autolink body is built from URL characters only; `<` and `>` are not URL
characters, so a `<` inside the angle brackets cannot be part of the body. The
whole run is not an autolink and renders as fully escaped literal text (grammar
`url_autolink` / `url_char`).

::: compare

```carve
<http://a.com/<script>>
```

```html
<p>&lt;http://a.com/&lt;script&gt;&gt;</p>
```

:::

`url_char` also excludes `"` `\` `` ` `` `{` `}` `|` `^`, so a double quote inside the brackets breaks the autolink. The whole run is literal text; the straight quotes additionally pick up smart-quote typography.

::: compare

```carve
<http://a.com/"q">
```

```html
<p>&lt;http://a.com/“q”&gt;</p>
```

:::

A clean URL with only `url_char`s autolinks normally, query string and all.

::: compare

```carve
<http://a.com/p?x=1>
```

```html
<p><a href="http://a.com/p?x=1">http://a.com/p?x=1</a></p>
```

:::

A well-formed `<url>` still autolinks normally.

::: compare

```carve
<http://a.com/>
```

```html
<p><a href="http://a.com/">http://a.com/</a></p>
```

:::

An email autolink requires a trailing dot and TLD (grammar `email_autolink`):
`<a@b.com>` becomes a `mailto:` link, but `<a@b>` (no dot+TLD) and `<x@y:z>`
(`:` is not an email character) are not email autolinks and stay literal.

::: compare

```carve
<a@b> <a@b.com> <x@y:z>
```

```html
<p>&lt;a@b&gt; <a href="mailto:a@b.com">a@b.com</a> &lt;x@y:z&gt;</p>
```

:::

## Escapes

A backslash before ASCII punctuation makes it literal.

::: compare

```carve
\*lit\* \[x\] \#h \@u
```

```html
<p>*lit* [x] #h @u</p>
```

:::

## Bare URLs stay literal

A bare URL is not auto-linked (matching djot); wrap it in `<…>` to link.

::: compare

```carve
see https://example.com now
```

```html
<p>see https://example.com now</p>
```

:::

## Inline span

A bracketed run followed by an attribute block is a `<span>`.

::: compare

```carve
A [styled run]{.hl} here.
```

```html
<p>A <span class="hl">styled run</span> here.</p>
```

:::

A valid attribute block forms a span even when it is empty — an empty `{}` is
the explicit "make this a span" hook (it can be decorated by a processor).

::: compare

```carve
[x]{}
```

```html
<p><span>x</span></p>
```

:::

A whitespace-only block (`{ }`) is also a valid empty block and forms the
same bare span.

::: compare

```carve
[x]{ }
```

```html
<p><span>x</span></p>
```

:::

A block whose content is not a recognized attribute (e.g. `{???}`) is not
an attribute block at all: the brackets and the block render literally.

::: compare

```carve
[x]{???}
```

```html
<p>[x]{???}</p>
```

:::

The bracket content is still inline-parsed even when the trailing block is
invalid, so emphasis inside the brackets is rendered.

::: compare

```carve
[*x*]{???}
```

```html
<p>[<strong>x</strong>]{???}</p>
```

:::

## Superscript and subscript

Superscript and subscript exist *only* in the braced forms `{^…^}` and
`{,…,}` (the same brace-pair family that forces intraword emphasis) — there is
no bare `^x^` or `,x,` delimiter. The dominant uses (H₂O, mc², 10⁶) are
intraword, which only the braced family can express, and a bare comma or caret
would collide with plain prose punctuation.

::: compare

```carve
H{,2,}O and E=mc{^2^}
```

```html
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O and E=mc<sup>2</sup></p>
```

:::

A `^` or `,` outside the braced forms is always literal text — even where a
bare delimiter's word-boundary rule would have matched:

::: compare

```carve
typo ,oops, happens and 10^6^ things and x ^2^ y
```

```html
<p>typo ,oops, happens and 10^6^ things and x ^2^ y</p>
```

:::

## Line blocks

A `::: |` block preserves the author's line layout: each soft line break becomes a hard break (`<br>`), a blank line starts a new stanza (`<p>`), and per-line leading whitespace is kept (each leading space serializes as `&nbsp;` in HTML). It renders as a generic `<div class="line-block">`. The pipe is the block's type token on the `:::` opener - not a per-line prefix - so it is free of the pipe/table ambiguity of the Pandoc per-line `|` form, with no English keyword.

:::: compare

```carve
::: |
Roses are red,
Violets are blue.
:::
```

```html
<div class="line-block">
  <p>Roses are red,<br>
Violets are blue.</p>
</div>
```

::::

Leading whitespace is preserved; each leading space becomes a non-breaking space so the indentation is visible without extra CSS.

:::: compare

```carve
::: |
Roses are red,
  Violets are blue.
:::
```

```html
<div class="line-block">
  <p>Roses are red,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Violets are blue.</p>
</div>
```

::::

A blank line separates stanzas; each stanza is its own paragraph inside the block.

:::: compare

```carve
::: |
Stanza one,
still one.

Stanza two.
:::
```

```html
<div class="line-block">
  <p>Stanza one,<br>
still one.</p>
  <p>Stanza two.</p>
</div>
```

::::

Inline markup inside a line block parses normally; only whitespace and line breaks are special.

:::: compare

```carve
::: |
*Bold* and /italic/,
plain line.
:::
```

```html
<div class="line-block">
  <p><strong>Bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>,<br>
plain line.</p>
</div>
```

::::

The behavior keys off the `|` type token on the opener, not the class. The inline `::: {.line-block}` class form is not a fence at all (strict djot: no inline attributes on the opener), so it renders as an ordinary paragraph (no div, no hard breaks).

:::: compare

```carve
::: {.line-block}
one
two
:::
```

```html
<p>::: {.line-block}
one
two
:::</p>
```

::::

For a smaller local opt-in to visible line breaks, use `::: \`. It turns soft breaks in direct paragraph children into hard breaks, but it does not preserve leading whitespace and does not affect nested blocks.

:::: compare

```carve
::: \
one
two
:::
```

```html
<div class="hardbreaks">
  <p>one<br>
two</p>
</div>
```

::::

Nested blocks keep ordinary soft-break behavior, and leading whitespace is not treated as alignment.

::::: compare

```carve
:::: \
  indented
next

::: note
a
b
:::
::::
```

```html
<div class="hardbreaks">
  <p>indented<br>
next</p>
  <aside class="admonition note">
    <p>a
b</p>
  </aside>
</div>
```

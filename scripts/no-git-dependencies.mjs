// Refuse a dependency that a consumer of this package cannot resolve from the

//
//   node scripts/no-git-dependencies.mjs [package.json]
//
// npm re-resolves a published package's dependency SPECS from the tarball's own
// manifest - the lockfile committed here is not consulted downstream - so a
// `github:` or `git+` spec in `dependencies` means every install of this bridge
// clones carve-js over git. Three consequences, all borne by the consumer: the
// install needs git and GitHub reachability (and resolves over SSH wherever an
// `insteadOf` rewrite is configured), npm has no registry tarball to check an
// integrity hash against, and a commit pin stops tracking the engine's releases
// so a consumer on a caret range still cannot receive an engine fix.
//
// This is a REGRESSION guard. 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 both shipped a
// `git+https://` engine spec; 0.1.2 moved it to `^0.1.4` and said so under
// Changed; a later branch put it back, and nothing inspected the manifest again
// until release prep. markup-carve/carve-grammars#276 added the same check there
// after the same regression reached the registry.
//
// It is wired into release.yml only, deliberately. A pull-request check would
// add nothing the suite does not already give: test/no-git-dependencies.test.mjs
// runs this script against the committed manifest on every pull request, so a
// newly added git dependency turns that test red long before a tag exists.
//
// ONE DEPENDENCY IS EXEMPT, AND THAT IS THE UNCOMFORTABLE PART. See EXEMPT
// below. The guard exists to reject a git dependency and currently waves one
// through, which is a hole by construction - so it is named outright, one
// package and one repository, rather than expressed as a pattern that would
// silently cover the next one too.
//
// Only `dependencies`, `optionalDependencies` and `peerDependencies` are
// inspected, because those are the three a consumer installs - npm fetches an
// optional dependency like any other and only tolerates its failure afterwards.
// A git `devDependency` costs a contributor a git clone and costs a consumer
// nothing, so it is left alone.
//
// DETECTION IS BY WHAT A SPEC IS NOT, and that inversion is the whole point.
// The list of spellings is where this leaks, and it has now leaked three times
// in this org: `git+https://` here, `github:` in carve-lsp, and npm's bare
// `owner/repo#ref` shorthand, which carries no protocol at all. Each fix added
// the next spelling to the list, which is why there was a next one. So the final
// test below is a CATCH-ALL over the characters a registry range cannot contain:
// whatever spelling comes after this one, it does not have to be anticipated to
// be caught.
//
// The rule the guard holds, stated positively: accept exactly what npm would
// resolve from the registry, which is a semver version, a semver range, a
// dist-tag, or an `npm:` alias WHOSE TARGET IS ITSELF ONE OF THOSE.
//
// That last clause is the fourth hole this guard family has had, and the only
// place the inversion still carried an unconditional ALLOW. `npm:` used to
// return early and clean, which is a denylist mistake pointing the other way:
// it never asked what the alias pointed AT, so `npm:github:owner/repo` and
// `npm:foo@git+https://x/y.git` walked past every test below it. npm refuses
// those itself ("aliases only work for registry deps"), so a consumer got a
// loud install error rather than a silent clone - wrong by this guard's own
// contract all the same (#133, markup-carve/carve-grammars#302).
//
// `npm-package-arg` - the module npm itself uses to classify a spec - is the
// oracle, and is deliberately NOT a dependency here: a publish-time guard that
// grows its own install-time dependency is a worse trade than a documented
// rule, and the agreement is measured rather than assumed. Over 117 spellings
// (versions, ranges, dist-tags, compound and prerelease ranges, every git,
// file, link, portal, workspace, catalog and tarball form, thirty-odd alias
// spellings including every one npa refuses, and the punctuation npm rejects in
// a name or a tag alongside the odd-looking tags it accepts) this script and
// npa agree on 114. Before #133 they agreed on 65.
//
// THE THREE THEY STILL DIFFER ON ARE DELIBERATE, and all three lean the same
// way - this script accepts what npm refuses, never the reverse. `foo bar` is a
// dist-tag carrying a space, which cannot be told from a range carrying a tab
// without a semver parser (see the whitespace note below). `npm:node_modules`
// and `npm:favicon.ico` are npm's two reserved names, and a two-name blacklist
// is a LIST - in a guard whose whole architecture is not being one, for names
// no manifest aliases. Each of the three is a garbage NAME that fails loudly at
// install; none is a git spec that clones silently, which is what this file
// exists to stop.

// and ListTable local headers (markup-carve/carve-js#1220). Neither is in any
// published carve-js: 0.1.4 is the latest on the registry and the pin is 19
// commits ahead of it. Restoring a registry range is not a downgrade of the pin,
// it is a bridge that silently drops table column alignment - `tsc` stays clean
// because the read is a cast, and five tests plus eight corpus documents fail at
// runtime instead. So the pin stays, and the release is allowed to go out with
// it, which is what this exemption buys.
//
// WHAT RETIRES IT. A published carve-js version carrying those two changes -
// 0.1.5 or later, whichever first ships `Table.columns`. When one exists:
// restore `@markup-carve/carve` to a registry range in package.json, delete this
// block along with `isExempt` and its call site, and flip the committed-manifest
// row in test/no-git-dependencies.test.mjs back from accept to reject. Nothing
// else in this file depends on it.
//
// WHY IT IS SPELLED THIS NARROWLY. "Any github: spec owned by markup-carve"
// would have been shorter and is exactly the hole this org keeps writing: it
// would cover every future sibling engine, grammar and tool without anyone
// deciding that it should. This matches ONE dependency name pointing at ONE
// repository at ONE commit-shaped ref, so a second git dependency - including

// encodeURIComponent encodes, and they are the most common specs in any
// manifest. Applying the tag rule to a range would therefore reject `^1.0.0`,
// which is the over-rejection this whole guard is written to avoid.
//
// So the range set is the URI-unreserved set plus semver's own operators. A
// spec outside it is neither a range nor a tag, and npm-package-arg refuses
// every one of them (`#bad`, `%bad`, `a,b`, `{x}`, `a&b`) while accepting the
